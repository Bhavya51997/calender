In this project I created a desktop python app that, can provide the advanced functionalities that are not generally available in the default calendar module.

When run, the application is able to ascertain the current day, date, month and year using the existing modules (Ex. Calendar)and  the rest of the functionalities should be purely computed based on the algorithm and the flow of thoughts captured.

The application expects the learners to compute a future calendar (future month, for that date) or a past calendar (past month) of the given date (today).

The application has designed in the way that:

- The application can be able to run with or without command line parameters.
- When the application is run without command line parameters, it should simply print the current monthâ€™s calendar with current date highlighted.
- The Month and Year should appear on the top
- The Days should appear in the next row 
- The current date should be highlighted.
